# Selection sort Algorithm

## Working of this algorithm:
- The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
- It repeats until no input elements remain.


## Complexity:
- Insertion sort has an average and worst-case running time of O(nÂ²), so in most cases, a faster algorithm is more desirable.
- Comparison to Insertion sort: Time Complexity of selection sort is always n(n - 1)/2, whereas insertion sort has better time complexity as its worst case complexity is n(n - 1)/2. Generally it will take lesser or equal comparisons then n(n - 1)/2.


## Advantages of Selection sort:

- Performs well for small data sets
- Because it is an in-place sorting algorithm, no additional temporary storage is required beyond what is needed to hold the original list.
- Its performance is easily influenced by the initial ordering of the items before the sorting process.

## Disadvantages of Selection sort:

- The primary disadvantage of the selection sort is its poor efficiency when dealing with a huge list of items.
- The selection sort requires n-squared number of steps for sorting n elements.
